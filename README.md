# Action-Recognition-and-pose-estimation
Aim of the Project
Aim of this project is to automatically recognize human actions based on analysis of the body landmarks using pose estimation Learning Outcome
1. Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network based pose estimation for body landmark detection
2. Implementation of pose features-based action recognition and its improvement using graphical feature representation and data augmentation of body landmarks<br>
3. Preparation and preprocessing of image datasets<br>
4. Fine tuning and improvement of the action recognition model with better feature representation and data augmentation<br>
5. Development, error analysis and deep learning model improvement<br>
